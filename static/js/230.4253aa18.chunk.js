My name's Andy He, a 20 year old software engineer based in the US! As much as I enjoy programming both at home and at work, I like to pass time in other ways. Music is something universal and naturally I'm no exception as I play, write and listen to music. (Some of my current favorites are at the bottom!) For something more stimulating, I prefer games for their incredible creativity or boxing for its intensive yet well rounded exercise. Though even juggling these hobbies, programming is THE hobby I go back to the most.","My programming experience started in middle school, when I first tried making games. They couldn't even be called games but I was proud of them. Online tutorials existed but they didn't suit my learning style and I put programming on hold. It wasn't until high school where I got a formal education in AP Computer Science, which is where things really took off and I started coding more serious projects. Sorting algorithm visualizers, API data aggregation and image manipulation, you name it and I did it. There were other options but it was then I knew, I needed to be a software engineer.","As of now my preferred language is C#, valued by myself and others for its diverse ecosystem. Me personally? The syntactic sugar is what really hooked me. However that isn't to say I'm not well-versed in other languages such as java, javascript, python and C. It's really a matter of preference! Currently, I'm a full-stack developer with strong foundations in both front-end and back-end but I'm interested in pursuing algorithms and how they can model our world."],l=a(444),h=a(184),d=/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent)?50:200,c=[],u=0;u<d;u++){var m=r(0,100),g=r(-10,10),w=r(30,80),f=Math.random(),y=(0,l.F4)(o||(o=(0,n.Z)(["\n\t\t","% { transform: translate(","vw, ","vh) scale(",");}\n    to { transform: translate(","vw, 100vh) scale(",");}\n\t"])),w,m+g,w,f,m+g/2,f),p=l.ZP.div(i||(i=(0,n.Z)(["\n\t\tfilter:\n\t\t\topacity: ",";\n\t\t\ttransform: translate(","vw, -10px);\n\t\t\tanimation: "," ","s ","s linear infinite;\n\t"])),Math.max(.1,Math.random()),m,y,r(10,30),-r(30));c.push((0,h.jsx)(p,{className:"snowflake"},"flake".concat(u)))}var v=function(){return(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"aboutme",children:[(0,h.jsx)("div",{className:"snow",id:"snow",children:c}),(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"boring-essay",children:[s.map((function(e,t){return(0,h.jsxs)("p",{children:[" ",e]},"p".concat(t))})),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuIXOBF0eyQ",children:"Chalili - La Vanille"}),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3vsRXOSBqc",children:"Eve - This World To You"}),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9J4epTWGM",children:"Rex Orange County - Pluto Projector"})]})]})}}}]);
