My name's Andy He, a 20 year old software engineer based in the US! As much as I enjoy programming both at home and at work, I like to pass time in other ways. Music is something universal and naturally I'm no exception as I play, write and listen to music. (Some of my current favorites are at the bottom!) For something more stimulating, I prefer games for their incredible creativity or boxing for its intensive yet well rounded exercise. Though even juggling these hobbies, programming is THE hobby I go back to the most.","My programming experience started in middle school, when I first tried making games. They couldn't even be called games but I was proud of them. Online tutorials existed but they didn't suit my learning style and I put programming on hold. It wasn't until high school where I got a formal education in AP Computer Science, which is where things really took off and I started coding more serious projects. Sorting algorithm visualizers, API data aggregation and image manipulation, you name it and I did it. There were other options but it was then I knew, I needed to be a software engineer.","As of now my preferred language is C#, valued by myself and others for its diverse ecosystem. Me personally? The syntactic sugar is what really hooked me. However that isn't to say I'm not well-versed in other languages such as java, javascript, python and C. It's really a matter of preference! Currently, I'm a full-stack developer with strong foundations in both front-end and back-end but I'm interested in pursuing algorithms and how they can model our world."],d=a(444),u=a(184),c=/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent)?50:200,m=[],g=0;g<c;g++){var f=o(0,100),w=o(-10,10),y=o(30,80),p=Math.random(),v=(0,d.F4)(i||(i=(0,r.Z)(["\n\t\t\t","% { transform: translate(","vw, ","vh) scale(",");}\n\t\t\tto { transform: translate(","vw, 100vh) scale(",");}\n\t\t"])),y,f+w,y,p,f+w/2,p),b=d.ZP.div(s||(s=(0,r.Z)(["\n\t\t\tfilter:\n\t\t\t\topacity: ",";\n\t\t\t\ttransform: translate(","vw, -10px);\n\t\t\t\tanimation: "," ","s ","s linear infinite;\n\t\t"])),Math.max(.1,Math.random()),f,v,o(10,30),-o(30));m.push((0,u.jsx)(b,{className:"snowflake"},"flake".concat(g)))}var I=function(){var e=(0,l.useState)([]),t=(0,n.Z)(e,2),a=t[0],r=t[1];return(0,l.useEffect)((function(){r(m)}),[]),(0,u.jsxs)("div",{className:"aboutme",children:[(0,u.jsx)("div",{className:"snow",id:"snow",children:a}),(0,u.jsxs)("div",{className:"boring-essay",children:[h.map((function(e,t){return(0,u.jsxs)("p",{children:[" ",e]},"p".concat(t))})),(0,u.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuIXOBF0eyQ",children:"Chalili - La Vanille"}),(0,u.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3vsRXOSBqc",children:"Eve - This World To You"}),(0,u.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9J4epTWGM",children:"Rex Orange County - Pluto Projector"})]})]})}}}]);
