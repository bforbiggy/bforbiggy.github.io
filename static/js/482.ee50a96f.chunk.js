My name's Andy He, a 20 year old software engineer based in the US! As much as I enjoy programming both at home and at work, I like to pass time in other ways. Music is something universal and naturally I'm no exception as I play, write and listen to music. (Some of my current favorites are at the bottom!) For something more stimulating, I prefer games for their incredible creativity or boxing for its intensive yet well rounded exercise. Though even juggling these hobbies, programming is THE hobby I go back to the most.","My programming experience started in middle school, when I first tried making games. They couldn't even be called games but I was proud of them. Online tutorials existed but they didn't suit my learning style and I put programming on hold. It wasn't until high school where I got a formal education in AP Computer Science, which is where things really took off and I started coding more serious projects. Sorting algorithm visualizers, API data aggregation and image manipulation, you name it and I did it. There were other options but it was then I knew, I needed to be a software engineer.","As of now my preferred language is C#, valued by myself and others for its diverse ecosystem. Me personally? The syntactic sugar is what really hooked me. However that isn't to say I'm not well-versed in other languages such as java, javascript, python and C. It's really a matter of preference! Currently, I'm a full-stack developer with strong foundations in both front-end and back-end but I'm interested in pursuing algorithms and how they can model our world."]),l=a(444),h=a(184),d=[],m=0;m<200;m++){var u=(0,s.Z)(0,100),c=(0,s.Z)(-10,10),g=(0,s.Z)(30,80),f=Math.random(),w=(0,l.F4)(n||(n=(0,o.Z)(["\n\t\t","% { transform: translate(","vw, ","vh) scale(",");}\n    to { transform: translate(","vw, 100vh) scale(",");}\n\t"])),g,u+c,g,f,u+c/2,f),y=l.ZP.div(r||(r=(0,o.Z)(["\n\t\tfilter:\n\t\t\topacity: ",";\n\t\t\ttransform: translate(","vw, -10px);\n\t\t\tanimation: "," ","s ","s linear infinite;\n\t"])),Math.max(.1,Math.random()),u,w,(0,s.Z)(10,30),-(0,s.Z)(30));d.push((0,h.jsx)(y,{className:"snowflake"},"flake".concat(m)))}var p=function(){return(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"aboutme",children:[(0,h.jsx)("div",{className:"snow",children:d}),(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"boring-essay",children:[i.map((function(e){return(0,h.jsx)("p",{children:e})})),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuIXOBF0eyQ",children:"Chalili - La Vanille"}),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3vsRXOSBqc",children:"Eve - This World To You"}),(0,h.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9J4epTWGM",children:"Rex Orange County - Pluto Projector"})]})]})}}}]);
