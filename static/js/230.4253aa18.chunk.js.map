My name's Andy He, a 20 year old software engineer based in the US! As much as I enjoy programming both at home and at work, I like to pass time in other ways. Music is something universal and naturally I'm no exception as I play, write and listen to music. (Some of my current favorites are at the bottom!) For something more stimulating, I prefer games for their incredible creativity or boxing for its intensive yet well rounded exercise. Though even juggling these hobbies, programming is THE hobby I go back to the most.\",\r\n\t\"My programming experience started in middle school, when I first tried making games. They couldn't even be called games but I was proud of them. Online tutorials existed but they didn't suit my learning style and I put programming on hold. It wasn't until high school where I got a formal education in AP Computer Science, which is where things really took off and I started coding more serious projects. Sorting algorithm visualizers, API data aggregation and image manipulation, you name it and I did it. There were other options but it was then I knew, I needed to be a software engineer.\",\r\n\t\"As of now my preferred language is C#, valued by myself and others for its diverse ecosystem. Me personally? The syntactic sugar is what really hooked me. However that isn't to say I'm not well-versed in other languages such as java, javascript, python and C. It's really a matter of preference! Currently, I'm a full-stack developer with strong foundations in both front-end and back-end but I'm interested in pursuing algorithms and how they can model our world.\",\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default Aboutters;"],"names":["randomInteger","minimum","maximum","undefined","Math","random","flakeCount","test","navigator","userAgent","snowflakes","i","random_x","offset","yoyo_time","random_scale","flakeAnimation","keyframes","Flake","styled","max","push","className","id","Aboutters","paragraph","index","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
