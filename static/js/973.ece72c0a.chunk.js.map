Truth be told, I didn't ever expect to get to live this long but I'm really glad I did. During this time, my life felt both agonizingly short and agonizingly long as I got to do many things and talk to many people. You're probably one of these people and I'm sure I had a lot of fun talking, even if it was for a brief time. It's hard though, because how in the world am I supposed to write to so many different kinds of people at once? Answer is, you can't! Whatever the case, I'm glad you're here, even if you may not stay.\",\r\n\t\t\t\"There are a lot of branching paths in my future to tell you the truth and I truly believe I had the ability to pick and choose any future. The following isn't the future but it was definitely a future: a future where I would be with none other than my friends. If I got upset, I'd complain and whine about it like a baby but get some banter in return. If I found something interesting, I'd share it without a thought'. Most importantly, I'd share thoughts even if they're something stupid like why routers don't have 20 antenna sticks pointing in all directions. We'd get to go out and hang out but if you're an online friend, I'd one day make plans to come meet you. I'm sure that no matter what, they would be the happiest moments of my life.\",\r\n\t\t\t\"But that was a future, not the future. The thing is, I've had enough experiences to know that I'm the problem. I'm happy with myself and others, but I've learned that someone like me just isn't made to be with other people. I tried so, so, so hard to prove myself wrong and prevent some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy from happening but in the end, this is how it is. Have you ever heard of expected value? It's a mathematical way of calculating the net value of a game over time but the math's not looking good. My current future is full of misery but honestly it's irrelevant as long as I have my friends. The problem is that I'll keep making the same choices, choices that hurt other people and that's why I can't possibly forgive myself. Not now, not ever.\",\r\n\t\t\t\"Some of you would definitely find something like this cringe and it's not like I can't see why. I'd like to think I have enough self-awareness to see how this is read by someone other than me. I'm not really one for writing as I'm sure some of you can tell. Without glancing, I can already tell the sentences don't flow together that well and not to mention I am writing this in one go from the head without revision to be as true to myself as possible. Who needs refinement right? Not like this is being graded or anything.\",\r\n\t\t\t\"So what now? Well, my life has always been more about other people than it has about me and I intend to hold true to that. Why would I focus on myself? I'm perfect and ain't nobody can beat perfect. Joking aside, if it was entirely up to me, I wouldn't have wrote any of this but some of you would wonder where I've gone and I wouldn't want to leave any of you in the dark. After all, you cared enough to click the link so thanks for that. It makes me sad to have to leave but don't any of you be sad because after all, I'm just one person. As for y'all, I'm sure all of you will find your own path in life and do just fine without my help. As for me, I'll take an early leave. I won't forget any of you and I'll promise to do better in the next life. Sorry, thank you and goodbye.\",\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t\tfor (var paragraph of farewellParagraphs)\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(paragraph);\r\n\t}, []);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className=\"farewell\">\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"snow\" id=\"snow\">{flakes}</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"boring-essay\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div style={{ display: 'none' }}> I'll never forget you three.
