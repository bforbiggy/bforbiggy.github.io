If you're just a curious stranger/programmer, you should probably stop reading since none of this would interest you anyways. Anyways hi friend and seeing as you're reading this, I am probably gone. God, it's super hard to talk as if I'm talking to every friend at once because you're all so different and special to me. That and the thing is, I have no idea how far into the future this actually is so you'll have to settle for the me as I am now. To you, I am sorry I couldn't give you a personal response so forgive me for that. I don't really want to set expectations high, this entirely thing is a run on sentence and the only thing I can really talk about is me even if I desperately wished to have been able to talk to each of you individually. Perhaps a different time, but certainly not now","If I'm being honest, sometimes I do think I'm more special than others but not in a way that makes me any better. Truth be told, I know I get a lot of compliments and have \"shown\" that I'm just built different but that's not actually true. I genuinely believe my talent is mediocre at best and sometimes I get scared that all it takes it someone working hard to overshadow me entirely. The reason I think I'm special only because I have really good empathy. All of my skills aren't skills I cultivated because I'm me but because I was able to become someone with actual talent. That's why I believe in all of you so much, each of you has so much more potential than I'd ever have. I said I was scared of someone overtaking but I'm more excited than scared because if someone manages to be better, then it just means I'll have to work harder to catch up! Then, it'd be a constant back and forth with an infinite positive feedback loop which I can only imagine would've been so fun to have. If I'm good, then you're all undoubtedly the best.","Though extreme empathy does come with a flaw and it's that I can even imagine my response perfectly in every scenario. Sounds good right? Well, for a long while it really was because I know how to respond to certain things and I can both understand and improve myself. It's just that at one point, I ended up knowing how I'd respond even in situations where I shouldn't know how I'd respond beforehand. When you know exactly when you'd have an emotional response, it makes it hard to have an emotional response anymore. It just wouldn't be genuine and I couldn't do that to you guys. It's not as if I didn't have emotions since I'm not that edgy but can you imagine pretending to have an emotional response? Maybe you'd all disagree but for me, I almost don't feel like I'm a person. That's why I think it'd be okay if I wasn't with people anymore, because a person like me just shouldn't be with other people.","I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little sad though. There's no way I can't not miss talking with people. Hell, you even took the effort to find the url for this page. It's hard enough for people to have  curiosity under the crushing weight of life let alone use it for a person like me. As sad as I am to miss people, I am more happy that I existed and got to meet all of you. Since I was a kid, my goal was always to make people happy and though at one point part of that goal was from external factors, most of my altruism was genuine and now it's all I care about. Don't think that I'm blindly sacrificing myself for that goal because I'm happy. Right now, there's nobody I'd rather be than me. I want to keep every part of myself, good or bad and there's truly nothing else I want for myself. That's why I'd be willing to sacrifice everything I have for someone else though there's only so much of me I can sacrifice.","What now? Well, everything I've written so far was at 3am with no rereading so I'm fairly certain it's all garbage. Even without rereading, I can tell that everything I've written is definitely one of my lowest quality writings in terms of flow. Hopefully the scholars of the future aren't too critical of my writings. This whole thing is just talking about how my talent is actually just other people's talent, who I am as a person because of my talent and how I feel about people and dying. There's only two things left because I am running out of time. The first thing is adding a link to a music video that I hope you'll like. Just because this whole mini-essay is terrible doesn't mean everything has to be right? I would've liked a whole catalogue of memes, art, music and whatever but the time is ticking. The last is kinda obvious but, it's my goodbye. It's the only part of this whole thing that truly matters to me.","I truly am glad to have met all of you and nothing would make me happier than seeing you all happy. I'm so sorry that I have to leave all of you like this but I promise to do better next time. Don't let one person get you down, you worry about living your life and being happy. As for me, I'm satisfied. Enjoy the rest of your lives everyone, I'll miss you!\n"],p=function(){return(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"farewell",children:[(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"snow",children:u}),(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"boring-essay",children:[I.map((function(e){return(0,r.jsx)("p",{children:e})})),(0,r.jsx)("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw1Flgub9s8",children:"A Gift"})]})]})}}}]);
